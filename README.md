<h2>Members: </h2>
Michael Rogers – I talked to Professor Szafir, and I had a situation with scheduling
and communication with team members. I am the sole member of my group, and I mis-scheduled
the assignment and have only been working on this since the 4th, as I misunderstood and thought
it was due the 11th. I worked very hard to get the data to run a bubble plot in D3, however, with
no team all I had for reference was Google. I was unable to get my D3 visualizations working in
time, so I made my visualizations on Tableau, and I’d like to explain them and how they are
useful even though I didn’t follow the requirements of the assignment.

<h2>Design and Running:</h2>
<u>Design Process:</u> When I was working with D3, I also was using python in order to scrub the data
and make it so it was useable in D3. This scrubbing and preprocessing was successful. I used
pandas, to sort through the CSV and get rid of unwanted data for my visualization, and I also
used pandas to get rid of null values and other useless data in the dataset. When I attempted to
read the scrubbed CSV into D3, I was unable to produce a working chart, hence the use of
Tableau. If I couldn’t get a chart working with D3 I figured it would be better to explain my
thinking behind each visualization instead.


<u>Running the Visualizations:</u> These are Tableau files so they must be ran in Tableau. However,
these are great visualizations that I feel explain the data and provide very useful insights into the
data. Once in Tableau, load the CSV as the source file, and open the workbook.

<h2>Visualizations:</h2>
<u>Visualization 1:</u> Visualization 1 is a Bubble chart where each bubble is a different country in the
dataset. The size of each bubble is determined by the count of the number of countries in the
dataset. This is a categorical representation of the data, and it shows from where in the world
these responses came from. From this visualization, we can see where most responses came from
and how that affects the different answers from the survey. As we can see, most of the responses
came from France, Germany, and Italy. This allows us to have insight into the backgrounds of
our participants. Another interesting visualization along these lines would be a map of the world
where each nation is the size of their response counts.


<u>Visualization 2:</u> This second visualization is also very useful in providing insights into the data.
In this visualization, the x-axis has been adjusted to show the most major spike in the data. This
data is showing the number of submissions by date. This is a very interesting visualization
because it gives a look into spikes in responses to the survey. I would be interested in finding out
why there was a massive spike around the night of August 22nd, 2017. This could provide
insights as to how to get participants to take the survey more based on prior successes.

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
Again, I apologize for not following the specifics of the assignment in the way that the visualizations were developed. I feel that these visualizations, while simple, provide an extremely useful and easy to understand when looking at an intimidating dataset such as this. The bubble chart provides very interesting background  on the participants of the survey, while the line graph provides a way to try to replicate large spikes.
